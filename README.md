This project analyzed two CSV data sets using Python.

PyBank: Created a Python script that analyzes financial records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
